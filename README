This is something I did for fun to mess around with Python,
Beautiful Soup, and the Cheetah templating system.

It is designed to take a long Television Without Pity review,
which can be over 20 web pages sometimes, and spit out a
single, clean page. You can try it out here (this repository 
is exactly this): 

http://www.givegoodweb.com/tools/twop/ (no longer there)

(example URL to use - prob no longer there either)
http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/dancing_with_the_stars/season_12_performance_4.php

For me it's a handy little tool, and was a good way to learn 
a few things. But it turned into a kinda of a popular tool necessitating some basic caching.
